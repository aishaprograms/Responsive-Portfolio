# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a portfolio created by and about Aisha Ahmad using responsive design and media queries.
This takes the Basic-Portfolio and optimizes it for mobile responsiveness. There are media query breakpoints at 980px, 768px, and 640px. 
At 980px, the main content is reduced in width by 10%, and the spacing between the elements is reduced.
At 768px, all elements are given a width of 100% except the header and its child elements/ classes of logo and nav.
At 640px, all elements are given a width of 100% and appropriate margins are established. The header is made static.

This site is commented throughout. The mobile version has stacked content to create longer pages. 

There is a CSS animation on the logo of all pages. It slides in, increases in size, then returns to normal.
